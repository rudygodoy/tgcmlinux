Some USB GSM-modems must be switched to its modem-functionality before they
can be used. This switching is done with the help of the application
'usb_modeswitch' and a proper configuration file. Actually the distributions
provide 'usb_modeswitch' config files for the most common modems, but
in some cases it's required to add a new one. This README describes the
steps for installing a new config file with the help of the Tgcm build
environment.

- First check that after the modem's plug-in, the typical serial ttyUSB-ports
  are created. If this is not the case, check if 'usb_modeswitch' tries to
  switch the device by checking the '/var/log/syslog'

  If this doesn't happen probably you need to get a config file for 'usb_modeswitch.'
  Search in the www with your preferred search engine for it and copy this
  file to the directory '../usb_modeswitch/'. Now edit the udev-rule
  '77-mobile-manager.rules.in' and add a line with the new configuration file.

  IMPORTANT: After changes in the udev-rule, the script 'autogen.sh' must be
  executed again.

- Now check in the log file '/var/log/mobile-manager.log' if the modem is
  recognized. If this not the case, probably the internal devices table
  of the Mobile Manager must be updated. This table is placed in the
  file "DevicesTable.py" (under "src") and has different sections for
  vendors and products. Search the proper vendor and add the new product
  to its list. Now (hopefully) the new device is recognized and the Tgcm
  displays it in the Device Zone.
